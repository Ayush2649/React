// Functional Component is nothing but a JavaScript function that returns a React element.
// Props (Properties) are nothing but arguements to that function
// Passing a prop to a component is just like passing an arguement to a function
// Config-driven UI, also known as Configuration-Driven UI (CDUI), is a design pattern where the structure, layout, and behavior of a user interface are defined and controlled by external configuration data rather than being hard-coded within the application's source code.

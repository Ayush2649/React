# Namaste React 🚀

- Why React is so fast??
    - It makes the DOM Operations very fast
    - It has one of the best rendering mechanisms

# Parcel 📦
- Dev Build
- Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++
- Caching - Faster Builds
- Image Optimization (Usually is the most costly task)
- Minification of files
- Bundles all the files
- Compress
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling - Support older browsers
- Diagnositcs
- Error Handling
- Tree Shaking - Remove unused code
- Differnet dev and prod bundles

- Functional Component is nothing but a JavaScript function that returns a React element.
- Props (Properties) are nothing but arguements to that function
- Passing a prop to a component is just like passing an arguement to a function
- Config-driven UI, also known as Configuration-Driven UI (CDUI), is a design pattern where the structure, layout, and behavior of a user interface are defined and controlled by external configuration data rather than being hard-coded within the application's source code. 

# Two Types of Import / Export

1. Default Import / Export
    - Export default Component              (Component - Example file name)
    - Import Component from (file location)

2. Named Import / Export
    - Export const Component
    - Import {Component} from (file location)

# React Hooks
They are normal JS utility functions
There are two important Hooks
- useState() : Superpowerful State Variables in React
- useEffect()

- Whenever a State Variable updates, React rerenders the component  

# Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
Virtual DOM is representaion of Actual DOM

# Diff Algorithm
- It just finds out the differnece between the Virtual DOMs

                     (Clicks on button)
Root with seven nodes       =>         Root with 3 nodes

- Whenever State Variable updates, React triggers a Reconciliation cycle(rerenders the component)

- Everytime the component is rendered, useEffect will be called
    - if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
    - if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render only
    - if dependency array is [btnContent] => useEffect is called whenever the [btnContent] is updated
